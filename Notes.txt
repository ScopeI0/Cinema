Domutils is redundant and not in use, is there a way to get rid of it?
Not all nodes need to be traversed when css-selecting, is there a way to avoid fully walking the DOM?

JS HTML Parsers:
 - @selderee/plugin-htmlparser2     > Ecosystem, does css selecting differently.
 - zeed-dom                         > How do they construct a select function from css-what token arrays? It supports JSX.
 - html-dom-parser                  > Provides a custom tokenizer option.
 - node-html-parser                 > Built-in css query support?
 - neutron-html5parser              > The origins of html parsing in JS. It is only 300 lines of code, has a DOM builder?
 - html5parser                      > Is it merely a tokenizer?
 - htmljs-Parser                    > The fastest, is it merely a tokenizer and only event based?

Use case specific Regex | C | Golang | Rust for absolute performance-phobia?

Use lxml and write a css to path converter? Or just use xpath?
Is sax basically the event based parser? Are they more useful for my use case than DOM constructing?
